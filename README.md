🚀 Excited to introduce my latest Python package for polynomial fitting! 📈

🎨 Graphical User Interface (GUI): Say goodbye to complex command-line interfaces! With the intuitive GUI built using tkinter, fitting polynomials to your data has never been easier. Simply input your data, specify the degree of the polynomial, and let the magic happen!

💼 Seamless Integration with Batch Files: I understand the importance of efficiency. That's why I have included batch file support for effortless execution. With just a double-click, you can run the script without worrying about Python environments or command-line hassles.

🛠️ No Python Environment Interference: Worried about messing up your Python environment? Don't be! This simple package runs smoothly without interfering with your existing setup, ensuring a hassle-free experience every time.

🌟 Key Features:

Fit polynomials of any degree to your data.
Visualize the fitted curve alongside observed data points.
Obtain optimized coefficients and R-squared value for analysis.
