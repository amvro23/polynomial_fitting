🚀 Excited to introduce my latest Python package for polynomial fitting! 📈

🎨 Graphical User Interface (GUI): Say goodbye to complex command-line interfaces! With the intuitive GUI built using tkinter, fitting polynomials to your data has never been easier. Simply input your data, specify the degree of the polynomial, and let the magic happen!

💼 Seamless Integration with Batch Files: I understand the importance of efficiency. That's why I have included batch file support for effortless execution. With just a double-click, you can run the script without worrying about Python environments or command-line hassles.

🛠️ No Python Environment Interference: Worried about messing up your Python environment? Don't be! This simple package runs smoothly without interfering with your existing setup, ensuring a hassle-free experience every time.

🌟 Key Features:

Fit polynomials of any degree to your data.
Visualize the fitted curve alongside observed data points.
Obtain optimized coefficients and R-squared value for analysis.

To get started with the Polynomial Fitting package, simply follow these steps:

1. **Download**: 
   - Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/amvro23/polynomial_fitting/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) containing the package.

2. **Extract**: 
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

3. **Run the GUI**:
   - Double-click the provided batch file (`polynomial_calculator.bat`) to run the graphical user interface (GUI).
   - Import the values for x (independent variable), y (dependent variable), and the desired degree of polynomial fitting.
   - Obtain optimized coefficients and R-squared value for analysis.

Note that the following packages should be installed in your compouter: numpy, scipy, matplotlib
If not, you can: 
   - Move to the location of the downloaded file: C:\Users\admin>cd C:\Users\admim\*******\polynomial_main\requirements.txt
   - Siimply run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
